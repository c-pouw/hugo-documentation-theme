summary: "Pedestrians are commuting continuously around the globe traveling to and from different destinations e.g. to work, school, supermarket, sports club.

The arrival process is often modulated by characteristics such as office hours, train frequencies, and queue formations, besides, pedestrian groups generate very frequent and correlated arrivals. However, all this complexity is usually disregarded: in the practice, pedestrian arrival processes are often simplified by Poisson models, i.e. arrivals are completely defined by an average inter-arrival time. This is most likely due to the absence of high-resolution data sets that span sufficiently large time scales. Thanks to the recent emergence of accurate privacy-respectful pedestrian tracking we can build sophisticated high-statistics data sets which enable us to analyze the arrival process far more accurately. For this purpose, we present an in-depth analysis of the pedestrian arrival process from a privacy-respectful data set measured at a real-life Dutch train platform. From the high-statistics trajectory data, we determine the frame-interpolated time of entering or leaving a train platform. The signal contains approximately 13 million pedestrian arrivals between 2017 and 2019. The timescales in this data set range from sub-second intervals to seasonal changes. Guided by a renormalization flow principle we analyze the signal at different timescales seeking patterns and self-similarities. The practical implications of this work are arrival models that go beyond Poisson processes and are thus capable of describing the statistics of real-life arrival processes with far higher accuracy."

## Abstract
Pedestrians are commuting continuously around the globe traveling to and from different destinations e.g. to work, school, supermarket, sports club. The exact moments and the frequency in which pedestrians enter and leave certain places or facilities defines a complex random arrival process inherently connected to the crowd flows and their many timescales. The arrival process is often modulated by characteristics such as office hours, train frequencies, and queue formations, besides, pedestrian groups generate very frequent and correlated arrivals. However, all this complexity is usually disregarded: in the practice, pedestrian arrival processes are often simplified by Poisson models, i.e. arrivals are completely defined by an average inter-arrival time. This is most likely due to the absence of high-resolution data sets that span sufficiently large time scales. Thanks to the recent emergence of accurate privacy-respectful pedestrian tracking we can build sophisticated high-statistics data sets which enable us to analyze the arrival process far more accurately. For this purpose, we present an in-depth analysis of the pedestrian arrival process from a privacy-respectful data set measured at a real-life Dutch train platform. From the high-statistics trajectory data, we determine the frame-interpolated time of entering or leaving a train platform. The signal contains approximately 13 million pedestrian arrivals between 2017 and 2019. The timescales in this data set range from sub-second intervals to seasonal changes. Guided by a renormalization flow principle we analyze the signal at different timescales seeking patterns and self-similarities. The practical implications of this work are arrival models that go beyond Poisson processes and are thus capable of describing the statistics of real-life arrival processes with far higher accuracy.
